<p>Race Direction is allowed to modify or change procedures for any reason but not without notification in the riders briefing.</p>
<p>A)Start Procedure with lights:</p>
<p>The final choice of motorcycle to be used in a race should be made before the motorcycle is brought into the waiting zone. However, the final decision must be made 15 minutes before the start of the warm-up lap(s).</p>
<p>The start procedure for the Races is the following:</p>
<p>As of 15 minutes (or halfway of current race) before the start of the Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<p>The paddock entrance to the waiting zone is open.</p>
<p>Adjustments to the motorcycles can be made. Refueling is forbidden.</p>

<p>The motorcycle of each rider must be placed in the waiting zone.</p>
<p>10 minutes before the start of the Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound,whistle signal or announcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>5 minutes before the start of the Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<p>The entrance from the paddock to the waiting zone remains open.</p>
<p>The motorcycles of all the riders must be on the starting grid.</p>
<p>It is still possible to use tire warmers and make adjustments to the motorcycles.</p>
<p>4 minutes before (or 2 laps to go of current race) the start of the Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<p>Display of the 4-minute board + sound or whistle signal or announcement.</p>
<p>The generators must be disconnected. The tire warmers must be removed from</p>
<p>the tires. Generators, tire warmers and other equipment must be removed from the waiting zone.</p>
<p>Everyone except the riders, one mechanic and umbrella holder per rider, the</p>
<p>photographers, the television crew and the essential officials must leave the starting grid.</p>
<p>The entrance from the paddock to the waiting zone is closed.</p>
<p>If a rider has a mechanical problem and the motorcycle cannot be repaired in the waiting zone, he is allowed to push his motorcycle to the pit lane, where he and/or his mechanics may attempt to repair it.</p>
<p>If the mechanics succeed in repairing the motorcycle before the leading rider has completed the first of the compulsory warm-up lap(s), the rider in question must stay in the pit lane and must start compulsory warm-up lap(s) from that position, after having received the release signal from the Clerk of the Course. The rider in question will keep his position on the starting grid.</p>
<p>If the mechanics only succeed in repairing the motorcycle after the leading rider has completed the compulsory warm-up lap(s), the rider in question must stay in the pit lane and must start the Race from that position.</p>
<p>2 minutes before (or 1 lap to go of the current race) the start of the Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<p>Display of the 2-minute board + sound or whistle signal or announcement.</p>
<p>All adjustments to the motorcycles must be completed.</p>
<p>The riders put on their helmets, start their engines and prepare for the compulsory warm-up lap(s).</p>
<p>1 minute before (or checkered flag of the current race) the start of the Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<p>Sound or whistle signal or announcement.</p>
<p>Riders should be prepared to be released to exit the waiting zone and begin the  starting grid and prepare for the compulsory warm-up lap(s).</p>
<p>Procedure for the Warm-Up laps:</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Course walks down the starting grid from row 1 to the end, stopping at each row and holding two red flags crossed. Upon his signal, the riders of that row start the compulsory warm-up lap(s).</p>
<p>If a rider stalls his engine, he must remain on the starting grid and raise his arm.</p>
<p>Immediately after all the riders have left for the compulsory warm-up laps, he must push his motorcycle into the pit lane or another area, as ordered by the officials and under their supervision.</p>
<p>If he succeeds in starting the motorcycle before the leading rider has completed the the compulsory warm-up lap(s), the rider in question will keep his position on the starting grid. However, he must wait for the orders of the Clerk of the Course to start the compulsory warm-up lap(s).</p>
<p>If he only succeeds in starting the motorcycle after the leading rider has completed the compulsory warm-up lap(s), the rider in question must go to and stay in the pit lane or other area and must start the Race from that position.</p>
<p>When all the riders have left the starting grid, the Clerk of the Course will give a signal and any riders whose motorcycle failed to start or whose motorcycles were late arriving at the starting grid are released to do the compulsory warm-up lap(s).</p>
<p>Start practices and unnecessary stops are not allowed during the Warm-Up laps.</p>
<p>At the end of the compulsory Warm-Up lap(s):</p>
<p>The Race Director will stand at the front of the starting grid displaying a red flag.</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Course will stand at the back of the starting grid with a green flag and display it when the grid is complete.</p>
<p>Any rider who encounters mechanical problems during the warm-up laps may go to the repair zone and make repairs. He cannot return to the starting grid.</p>
<p>Marshals will display panels, at the side of the track, indicating the row of the starting grid, to assist riders in locating their position. On returning to the grid the riders must take their position in an orderly way with the front wheel of their motorcycle up to the line defining their starting grid position and keep their engines running.</p>
<p>Once a rider has taken his allocated position on the starting grid, he cannot change it, return to the pit lane or receive assistance prior to the start.</p>
<p>As each row of the starting grid is completed, the marshals will lower their panel, indicating that their row is completed.</p>
<p>When all the panels have been lowered, the Clerk of the Course at the rear of the starting grid will raise the green flag.</p>
<p>If by 30 seconds before the start, all the panels have not been lowered, the</p>
<p>Race Director may order the start to go ahead.</p>
<p>Any rider who arrives back from the warm-up laps after the Clerk of the Course at the rear of the starting grid has raised the green flag, will be considered a “late arrival“.</p>
<p>Late arriving riders at the grid will lose their initial position at the starting grid and must take a position at the rear of the grid. They must stop behind the Clerk of the Course and start the race from there (the row following the last row of riders).</p>
<p>If a rider has mechanical problems at the starting grid, he must remain on his motorcycle and raise his arm. It is not permitted to attempt to delay the start by any other means.</p>
<p>Panels will not be lowered, or must be raised again, when a rider in that row has indicated that he has stalled his motorcycle or has other difficulties.</p>
<p>Any rider who is unable to start his motorcycle within a reasonable time, must obey the instructions of the officials and remove his motorcycle to the pit lane  or other area where he and/or his mechanics may make further attempts to start it. If he succeeds/they succeed in starting the engine, he must take the start from this position.</p>
<p>15 seconds before the start:</p>
<p>The Race Director moves to the side of the track, holding up the red flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a rider has mechanical problems at the starting grid, he must remain on his motorcycle and raise his arm. It is not permitted to attempt to delay the start by any other means. As of then, he must immediately obey the instructions of the officials and remove his motorcycle to the back of the starting grid. He must remain there until the start has been given.</p>
<p>If by then he has succeeded in starting the motorcycle, he can start from that position. However, he must wait for the orders of the Clerk of the Course to take the start of the Race.</p>
<p>If he did not succeed in starting the motorcycle, he must proceed to the pit lane upon instruction of an official, where he and/or his mechanics may make further attempts to start it. Failure to obey the instructions of the officials may result in a penalty or disqualification.</p>
<p>As of then:</p>
<p>As of then, the Race Director puts down the red flag and the start light sequence begins.</p>
<p>A red light (or SERIES of 5 Red Lights) will be displayed for between 2 and 5 seconds. The red light(s) will go out to start the race.</p>
<p>Riders still in the pit lane must wait until the pit marshal situated at this exit, upon a signal from the Race Director/Clerk of the Course, lowers the red flag in order to authorize any riders still in the pit lane to leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) Start Procedure with flags</p>
<p>Whenever it is not possible to start the race by means of the red light, flags will be used to give the start.</p>
<p>The same start procedure (as mentioned above) will be maintained until</p>
<p>15 seconds before the start of the Race.</p>
<p>As of then:</p>
<p>The Race Director moves to the side of the track, holding up the red flag.</p>
<p>If a rider has mechanical problems at the starting grid, he must remain on his motorcycle and raise his arm. It is not permitted to attempt to delay the start by any other means.</p>
<p>As of then, he must immediately obey the instructions of the officials and remove his motorcycle to the pit lane or other area where he and/or his mechanics may make further attempts to start it. Failure to obey the instructions of the officials may result in a penalty or disqualification.</p>
<p>As of then:</p>
<p>The Race Director puts down the red flag and displays the starting flag. The Race Director will lower the starting flag between the 1-10 seconds upon which the Race starts.</p>
<p>C) Anticipated start</p>
<p>If the front wheel spindle of the motorcycle crosses the line which marks the front</p>
<p>of that rider’s starting position on the grid before the red light goes out or the flag is raised, this will be considered as an anticipated start.</p>
<p>Upon recommendation of the Race Director, the rider concerned will be penalized with a “Stop and Go“ penalty.</p>
<p>D) “Stop and Go“ penalty</p>
<p>Upon recommendation of the Race Director, a board displaying “STOP &amp; GO“ as well as his riding number, will be shown at the finish area to the rider who made the false start.</p>
<p>During the race, the rider in question must go to the designated “Stop and Go“</p>
<p>penalty zone. He must bring his motorcycle to a stop (the engine must not be turned off) and remain stationary for a full 5 seconds. He may then rejoin the race.</p>
<p>This procedure is under the strict control of designated marshals.</p>
<p>Failure by the rider in question to stop, after having been shown the “STOP &amp; GO“ board three times, will result in that rider being shown the black flag.</p>
<p>If more than one rider is penalized, the riders will be signaled to stop on subsequent laps. The order of “Stop and Go“ penalties will be based on the results that determine the riders’ starting positions for the Race in question with the faster rider stopping first.</p>
<p>In the case of a rider failing to respond to the instruction to stop in the “Stop and Go“ penalty zone, and there being more than one rider penalized, no subsequent rider will be signaled to stop until the previous rider has stopped or been shown the black flag.</p>
<p>In the case of a re-started race, the above regulations will also apply.</p>
<p>In the case where the marshals have been unable to carry out the “Stop and Go“ procedure before the end of the race, the rider in question will be inflicted with a time penalty of 15 seconds.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a name='sec8'><b>8. STOPPING OF A PRACTICE/RACE</b></a> <em>(Ref. 042.22)</em></p>
<p>The Race Director is authorized to prematurely stop any Practice, Qualifier or Race for urgent and/or safety reasons or other cases of “force majeure“. In that case, a red flag will be displayed to the riders.</p>
<p>If a Race is stopped before 50% of the racing distance has been covered, there will be a complete restart. The starting grid positions will be based on the placing of riders on the lap before the red flag was displayed.</p>
<p>Riders will return to the pit lane and the restart will take place as soon as possible after the red flag was displayed.</p>
<p>Changing of motorcycles will be allowed. The final choice must be made before the Warm-Up laps preceding the restart.</p>
<p>If one or more riders are deemed to be at fault for the race being stopped, the Race Director may recommend to the other Members of the Race Direction to exclude them from taking part in the restart or to penalize them with loss of starting grid position. In that case, the rider(s) concerned must start from the row following the last row of riders.</p>

<p><a name='sec13'><b>13. RESULTS</b></a> <em>(Ref. 042.27)</em></p>
<p>A) Procedure</p>
<p>The winner of a Race is the rider who crosses the finish line first. The riders that are still racing will then be stopped when crossing the finishing line.</p>
<p>The time at which a motorcycle crosses a control line shall be registered at the moment the foremost part of the motorcycle crosses the line.</p>
<p>When crossing control lines, the rider must always be in contact with the motorcycle.</p>
<p>Races are officially ended at the completion of the lap at which the checkered flag is displayed to the winner.</p>
<p>All the riders participating in the race will be classified in order of finish and number of laps completed; i.e. all riders finishing on the same lap as the winner will be classified in the order they cross the finish line, followed by riders with one less lap, then two laps and so on. Riders must cross the finish line within 5 minutes of the arrival of the winner, i.e. riders have 5 minutes to complete the lap or it will not be counted in their result.</p>
<p>The procedure to determine the classification in the results of riders who do not complete the lap within 5 minutes after the arrival of the winner will be according to the number of laps completed, and in the event of a tie, according to their finishing order at the end of the preceding lap.</p>
<p>If the checkered flag is mistakenly displayed later than the official time/distance, the finishing order shall be determined by the running order at the official time/ distance.</p>
<p>Under any other circumstances, such as mistaken display of the checkered flag before the official time/distance, the finishing order shall be determined by the running order at the time the checkered flag is displayed.</p>
<p>The winner of the Grand Prix is the rider who has obtained the most points; the runner-up will be the rider who has obtained the second best number of points, and so on, irrespective of the number of races they have finished.</p>
<p>If a tie exists, the points scored in the third race will determine the order of placing in the final standings of the event of those riders who scored points.</p>
<p>The overall results will be completed with those riders who have not scored any series points. They will be ranked by adding their positions obtained in the races. Of these riders, the rider who has obtained the smallest overall placing will be placed first behind those riders who have scored points. He will be followed by the 2nd placed non-point scoring rider and so on.</p>
<p>If a tie exists, the position in the third race will determine the order of placing in the final standings of the event of those riders who did not score any points.</p>
<p>All results must be homologated by the Race Direction.</p>
<p>The results will not become official until the time limits for protests have elapsed.</p>
<p>If a protest is lodged, the results will not become official until a decision has been taken by the competent bodies.</p>
<p>If an appeal is lodged against the decision of the Race Direction, the results cannot be considered as definitive until a final decision has been taken by the competent body.</p>
